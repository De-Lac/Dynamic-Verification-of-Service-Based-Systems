to create the WS PortTypeImpl skeleton from a WSDL, 
I used the wsdl2java maven plugin. It needs to
specify the wsdl path in the pom. After that, I run
just the mave phase "generate-sources" on the 
maven sub-project "impl_skeleton" and it generates all the
classes in the target folder. Actually I need the interface
under target/generated-sources/xxx/yyy//contract/serviceName/zzzPortType.java

I need just the method names... i don't need all the annotations.
